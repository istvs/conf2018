# 10th Asia-Pacific Conference of ISTVS

**Joint 10th Asia-Pacific Conference of ISTVS**\
**and 39th Annual Meeting of Japanese Society for Terramechanics**

**July 11-13, Kyoto, Japan, 2018**

#### **Conference Theme: **_**“Knowing Tradition & Promoting Innovation”**_

In Japan, we previously had four ISTVS conferences such as Kobe Conference of ISTVS in 1990, Hayama Conference of ISTVS in 2005, Okinawa Conference of Asia-Pacific ISTVS in 1995, and Sapporo Conference of Asia-Pacific ISTVS in 2010.

And now, we are glad to announce the 10th Asia-Pacific Conference of ISTVS 2018 in Kyoto, Japan.

This Asia-Pacific Conference of ISTVS will jointly be held with The 39th Annual Meeting of The Japanese Society for Terramechanics. We expect the conference will become a good opportunity for foreign and domestic researchers, engineers, or students who are interested in terramechanics, to exchange views or ideas on recent development in terrain-vehicle systems.
